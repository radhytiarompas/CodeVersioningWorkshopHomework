# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files and collaborating on software projects.
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
Git helps in managing different versions of a project, rollback to previous states, and collaborate with teammates efficiently.
When facing challenges, documentations and forums are available online to help us.
